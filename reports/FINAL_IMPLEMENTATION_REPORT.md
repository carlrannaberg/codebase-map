codebase-map scan --include "src/**/*.ts"

# Exclude test files from scan
codebase-map scan --exclude "**/*.test.ts" --exclude "**/*.spec.ts"

# Combined patterns for focused analysis
codebase-map scan --include "src/**" --exclude "**/*.test.*"
```

### Monorepo Patterns
```bash
# Scan only package source files
codebase-map scan --include "packages/*/src/**" --exclude "**/node_modules/**"

# Focus on specific packages
codebase-map scan --include "packages/{api,ui}/src/**"
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Enable verbose mode for pattern debugging
codebase-map scan --include "src/**" --verbose

# Run performance benchmarks
npm run benchmark
```
